Cat’s Eye, also called Lehsunia, is connected with Ketu in Vedic astrology and is considered a powerful protective gemstone. It is believed to act like a shield against negative energies, evil influences, sudden accidents, and hidden enemies. People who often face unexplained hurdles, financial instability, or sudden losses may benefit from wearing this stone. Cat’s Eye is also associated with spiritual awakening, psychic abilities, and detachment from material illusions, helping individuals progress on the path of self-realization. Businessmen, gamblers, or people involved in speculative trades often use Lehsunia to reduce risks and gain sudden financial benefits. It is also known to improve intuition and protect against black magic or ill intentions of others. Since Cat’s Eye is a very powerful stone, it should only be worn after consulting an experienced astrologer, as it may not suit everyone. A genuine, certified gemstone is crucial for real benefits.
